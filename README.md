### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial data preparation, we performed the following tasks:

2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
1. What is overall Sales?
2. What quantity is sold?
3. Which are the top 5 Profitable customers?
4. which are the top 5 loss-making products?
5. How many orders were returned?
6. What are the average delivery days?

### Data Analysis
A visually appealing and intuitive dashboard was designed.
#### Key visualizations included:
Sales and Quantity trends over time.
Average Delivery days to monitor shipping efficiency.
Returned Orders to understand the return rate.
Top 5 Profitable Products and Top 5 Loss-Making Products for product performance analysis.

#### Filters:
Filters for Year, Segment, Market, and Region were implemented to allow users to focus on specific subsets of data.
Dynamic filters enabled users to customize their view based on specific criteria.

#### User Interaction:
Interactive elements like slicers and drill-through actions were incorporated for a more immersive user experience.
Users could explore data by interacting with different visual elements and filter options.

### Conclusion
The E-commerce Analytics Dashboard provided stakeholders with a centralized platform to analyze critical metrics and make informed decisions. The visualizations offered a real-time snapshot of sales trends, delivery efficiency, and product performance. The ability to filter data based on various parameters ensured that users could tailor their analysis to specific business needs.
